|Pricing|Pros|Cons|
|-|-|-|
|~$50 USD|TheRigid mounting solution enables "one-handed" nozzle changes.|The slightly longer melt-zone gives results in low-medium flow rates ~15mm^3/s.|
| | It has a marginally longer melt-zone when compared to the E3D V6.| - It is easy to strip the M1.4 screws that attach the heater block to the frame.|
| | Uses standard M3x15mm thermistor and M6x20mm heater cartridge. | Some argue that the Dragon is a "clone" of the Slice Engineering Mosquito.|
| | Ceramic heatbreak is available to print abrasive materials. | Tightly toleranced heat break is sensitive to poor quality filament that exceeds 1.75mm diameter.|

### Dragon High Flow

**Pricing**
- ~$55 USD

**Pros**
- TheRigid mounting solution enables "one-handed" nozzle changes.
- It has a longer melt-zone when compared to the standard flow version.
- Medium flow rates ~25mm^3/s
- Uses standard M3x15mm thermistor and M6x20mm heater cartridge.
- Ceramic heatbreak is available to print abrasive materials.

**Cons**
- Longer melt-zone makes retraction and tuning more difficult. Filaments like PETG are more likely to ooze during travel and heating.
- The extended melt-zone extends into the area that is cooled by the heat-break fan. This can be a problem when printing PLA in an enclosed printer, leading to heat-creep and eventual jams/clogs.
- Tightly toleranced heat break is sensitive to poor quality filament that exceeds 1.75mm diameter.
- It is easy to strip the M1.4 screws that attach the heater block to the frame.
- Some argue that the Dragon is a "clone" of the Slice Engineering Mosquito.
